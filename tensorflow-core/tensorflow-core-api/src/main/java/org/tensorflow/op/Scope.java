/**
 * Manages groups of related properties when creating Tensorflow Operations, such as a common name
 * prefix.
 *
 * <p>A {@code Scope} is a container for common properties applied to TensorFlow Ops. Normal user
 * code initializes a {@code Scope} and provides it to Operation building classes. For example:
 *
 * <pre>{@code
 * Scope scope = new Scope(graph);
 * Constant c = Constant.create(scope, 42);
 * }</pre>
 *
 * <p>An Operation building class acquires a Scope, and uses it to set properties on the underlying
 * Tensorflow ops. For example:
 *
 * <pre>{@code
 * // An operator class that adds a constant.
 * public class Constant {
 *   public static Constant create(Scope scope, ...) {
 *      scope.graph().opBuilder(
 *        "Const", scope.makeOpName("Const"))
 *        .setAttr(...)
 *        .build()
 *      ...
 *   }
 * }
 * }</pre>
 *
 * <p><b>Scope hierarchy:</b>
 *
 * <p>A {@code Scope} provides various {@code with()} methods that create a new scope. The new scope
 * typically has one property changed while other properties are inherited from the parent scope.
 *
 * <p>An example using {@code Constant} implemented as before:
 *
 * <pre>{@code
 * Scope root = new Scope(graph);
 *
 * // The linear subscope will generate names like linear/...
 * Scope linear = Scope.withSubScope("linear");
 *
 * // This op name will be "linear/W"
 * Constant.create(linear.withName("W"), ...);
 *
 * // This op will be "linear/Const", using the default
 * // name provided by Constant
 * Constant.create(linear, ...);
 *
 * // This op will be "linear/Const_1", using the default
 * // name provided by Constant and making it unique within
 * // this scope
 * Constant.create(linear, ...);
 * }</pre>
 *
 * <p>Scope objects are <b>not</b> thread-safe.
